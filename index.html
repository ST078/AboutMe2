I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  This helped me remember some css that I have used before. This also showed me
that it would be helpful if I started the assingment earlier.

			<h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
			<p class="ind">I enjoy playing volleyball to stay active. I got interested in volleyball because of a book a friend lent me. When I got into college, I decided to try taking a volleyball class. I really enjoyed playing volleyball in class and like playing when I can.</p>

			<p class="ind">Playing video games is something I enjoy doing in my spare time. I moved out for college, I decided to buy my own console because I wasn't allowed to have one in my parents house. I had enjoyed playing games at my friends house and I now had the freedom to play at my own house. I really enjoyed playing at my place and really enjoyed playing games like <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Beat Saber</em>, and <em>Sekiro</em>.</p>

			<p class="ind">When I have time I enjoy watching Movies. Some movies that I enjoy are <em>Pok&eacute;mon Detective Pikachu</em>, <em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</em>, and <em>1917</em>. I love watching how computer-genereated imagery (CGI) and visual effects (VFX) are used in movies. After watching a movie, it's fun to see how they made that movie and seeing all of the CGI that I missed because of how well it was done.</p>
